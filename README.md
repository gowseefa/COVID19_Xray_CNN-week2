# COVID19_Xray_CNN
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for binary classification of chest X-ray images into PNEUMONIA or NORMAL. This project demonstrates the use of deep learning for early detection of pneumonia

# Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow / Keras
CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
Google Colab

# Results
The model classifies X-ray images into PNEUMONIA or NORMAL.
Accuracy depends on dataset and training parameters.
